"Column 1","Column 2","Column 3","Column 4"
"Order","Topic / Concept","Priority","What to Do (Exactly)"
"1","Big‑O notation, time & space complexity estimation","Most important","Revisit; be able to estimate for your solutions in 30 secs."
"2","Arrays & easy operations (max/min, rotation, etc.)","Most important","Done.You're good here."
"3","Strings (anagrams, substrings, frequency)","Most important","Easy → medium bridging; 3–5 problems to warm up from arrays."
"4","Prefix Sum pattern(range sums, subarrays)","Most important","CRITICAL.Start here for medium bridging. 5–7 LC mediums on this alone."
"5","Sliding Window pattern(max/min in window, substrings)","Most important","CORE.Next after prefix sum; 8–10 LC mediums dedicated to this."
"6","Two‑pointers pattern(sorted arrays, pair sums)","Most important","After sliding window; bridges to hash map next."
"7","Hash map / hash set operations","Most important","Use for frequency problems, seen logic; 6–8 mediums."
"8","Monotonic Stack pattern(next greater, temp extremes)","Important","Often surprises candidates; 4–5 medium problems, then skip for now."
"9","Stack & Queue basics (balanced parens, BFS/DFS prep)","Most important","Foundational; 3–4 easy-mediums, then link to graph traversal."
"10","Binary Search(on array + answer space)","Most important","Very common medium; 5–7 problems. Practice timing yourself on these."
"11","Linked list basics","Important","Reverse, cycle, merge; 3–4 mediums. Not as common in Japan tech interviews."
"12","Recursion & DFS fundamentals","Most important","Prerequisite for trees/graphs; 2–3 simple DFS problems first."
"13","Binary Trees – traversals(pre/in/post, level order)","Most important","Master all 4; 5–6 mediums, then practice iterative versions too."
"14","Trees – Binary Search Trees (BST logic, LCA)","Important","3–4 mediums; understand insert/search/delete flow."
"15","Graph representation & DFS/BFS(islands, components)","Most important","6–8 mediums mixing DFS & BFS; critical graph foundation."
"16","Topological sort & directed graph cycles","Important","3–4 mediums; course schedule style problems."
"17","DP 1D – simple recurrence(climbing stairs, house robber)","Most important","MOST IMPORTANT DP.5–7 mediums; focus on ""how to form recurrence""."
"18","DP 2D – grid problems(unique paths, min path sum)","Important","4–5 mediums after solidifying 1D."
"19","DP – subsequences (LIS, LCS basics)","Important","2–3 mediums; lower priority than grid DP."
"20","Heap / Priority Queue(K‑largest, merge K lists)","Important","3–4 mediums; very practical, ties into interviews."
"21","Intervals pattern(merge, overlap, insert)","Important","3–5 mediums; common in scheduling/booking problems."
"22","Design questions – LRU, LFU cache","Important","Bridges DSA & system design; 2–3 medium problems on this."
"23","Bit manipulation basics","Optional","Skip for now; lower ROI for Japan interviews."
"24","Union‑Find (DSU)","Optional","Skip for now; can pick up if you see it in a problem."
"25","Shortest paths (Dijkstra, basic only)","Optional","Conceptual understanding enough; skip implementation."
"26","Advanced DP, segment trees, string algos","Optional","SKIP completely."
