"Order","Topic / Concept","Priority","What to Do (Exactly)"
"1","NFRs clarification framework(latency, throughput, HA, etc)","Most important","START HERE.1–2 hours. Practice asking: ""How many users? Peak QPS? Reads/writes ratio?"""
"2","Back-of-envelope estimation(QPS, storage, bandwidth)","Most important","2–3 hours; practice: ""Design Twitter → estimate tweets/sec → storage → bandwith"""

"6","Replication & sharding concepts","Important","2–3 hours; understand leader/follower, read replicas, sharding keys, hotspots."
"7","CAP theorem & consistency models (strong vs eventual)","Important","1–2 hours; intuitive explanations tied to real systems."
"8","Caching layers(CDN, in-memory cache, DB cache, strategies)","Most important","2–3 hours; cache-aside, write-through, invalidation patterns."
"9","Message queues & pub/sub (SQS/SNS patterns, Kafka-style)","Most important","2–3 hours;your SQS/SNS expertise.Explain idempotency + retries + DLQ."
"10","Microservices & service boundaries","Most important","2–3 hours;your existing experience.Talk about your 3–4 real projects."
"11","Service-to-service communication (REST, gRPC, async queues)","Most important","1–2 hours; draw flow diagrams."
"12","API design for scale(versioning, pagination, rate limits)","Most important","1–2 hours; you did ""60% API performance improvement"" ; explain deeply."
"13","Authentication & authorization(OAuth2, OpenID, JWT)","Most important","2–3 hours;fraud/biometric projects are gold here.Deep dive with examples."
"14","Web security in distributed systems (XSS, CSRF, DDoS mitigation)","Important","1–2 hours; enterprise clients care ."
"15","Idempotency, retries, rate limiting in APIs","Most important","2–3 hours; design with: ""What if a request retries 5 times?"""
"16","System Design Problem: URL Shortener","Most important","3–4 hours mock; sketch → explain → discuss tradeoffs. (Your roadmap already has this)"
"17","System Design Problem: Rate Limiter","Most important","3–4 hours mock; token bucket, sliding window, Redis impl. (Your roadmap)"
"18","System Design Problem: Notification System","Most important","4–5 hours mock; this is where you'll jump from 4→7. Multi-channel, user prefs, retries, observability."
"19","System Design Problem: Chat System(1:1 + online status)","Important","4–5 hours mock; WebSocket, pub/sub, consistency."
"20","System Design Problem: Payment / Checkout System","Most important","4–5 hours mock;perfect for your domain.Idempotency, audit, security."
"21","Observability (logs, metrics, tracing, alerting)","Most important","2–3 hours;your production war-room experience shines.Talk MTTR, SLOs."
"22","Fault tolerance (circuit breakers, timeouts, bulkheads)","Important","1–2 hours; ""How does the system survive if service X goes down?"""
"23","File storage & CDN (S3, signed URLs)","Important","1–2 hours; Next.js + S3 integration patterns."
"24","Search basics (high-level Elasticsearch concepts)","Optional","Skip for now unless a job asks for it."

"26","Event-driven architectures & eventual consistency flows","Important","2–3 hours; order lifecycle, saga pattern basics."
"27","Mock Interview Structure(how to conduct one)","Most important","1 hour study; then practice 1–2 mock interviews with friend/colleague."
"28","RBAC/ABAC & multi-tenant design","Optional","Skip unless targeting SaaS (PayPay, Money Forward)."
