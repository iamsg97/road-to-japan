"17","Destructuring (arrays, objects, nested, rest patterns)","Important","1 hour; practice extracting values in function params and variable assignments."
"18","Rest/spread operator (...) in arrays, objects, function params","Important","1 hour; understand difference in function params (rest) vs literals (spread)."
"19","Arrow functions, lexicalthis, implicit return, when NOT to use arrow functions","Important","1 hour; practice: method on object (use regular function, not arrow), constructor (use regular function)."
"20","Function declarations vs expressions, named function expressions","Important","1 hour; understand hoisting differences and when to use each."
"21","Default parameters, parameter validation patterns","Important","1 hour; edge cases:undefinedvsnullvs falsy values triggering defaults."
"22","call,apply,bindmethods (explicitthisbinding)","Most important","1.5–2 hours; practice: borrowing methods (Array.prototype.slice.call), partial application with bind."
"23","Object property descriptors,Object.defineProperty, getters/setters","Optional","1–1.5 hours; understanding:enumerable,configurable,writable, custom getters/setters logic."
"24","typeofvsinstanceof, checking types accurately (object, array, null edge cases)","Important","1 hour; understand:typeof null === 'object', whyinstanceofchecks prototype chain."
"25","DOM basics (query, create, update, remove, append, text vs innerHTML)","Important","1–1.5 hours; XSS pitfall with innerHTML; use textContent for text, innerHTML for safe HTML."
"26","Event propagation (capturing, bubbling, target vs currentTarget),stopPropagation,preventDefault","Most important","1.5–2 hours; practice: event delegation, understanding phase, preventing defaults (form submission, clicks)."
"27","addEventListeneroptions (capture, once, passive), event object","Important","1 hour; understand when to use capture phase vs bubbling; passive for scroll performance."
"28","Debounce & throttle implementation patterns","Most important","2–3 hours; implement both from scratch, understand tradeoffs, use cases (search, resize, scroll)."
"29","setTimeout,setInterval, clearing timers (clearTimeout,clearInterval)","Important","1 hour; understand: millisecond precision isn't guaranteed, relation to event loop."
"30","try/catch/finallywith async (async/await error handling)","Most important","1–1.5 hours; practice: catching promise rejections, async function errors, finally for cleanup."
